# Uncommon Python Bug: ZeroDivisionError Handling
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to zero division in Python and its solution.

The `bug.py` file contains the function `function_with_uncommon_error` that exhibits the issue. It attempts to handle cases where either `a` or `b` is zero, but fails when both are zero.

The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version of the function, demonstrating how to reliably handle this edge case.
